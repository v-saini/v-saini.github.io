I'm an Assistant Professor in the Department of Chemistry at Panjab University, Chandigarh, specializing in cutting-edge machine learning models to predict chemical properties and innovate synthetic methodologies in organic chemistry. With a Ph.D. from the University of Utah (2015) and postdoctoral research at the Novartis Institute for BioMedical Research, my journey has been fuelled by a passion for blending chemistry with computational science. At Panjab University, I lead a research group dedicated to advancing the frontiers of Machine Learning and organic synthesis.
